You can scale it up by adding more instances or scale down, to one instance, if you think of <a href="./edge.html">IoT and small edge devices</a>.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="example"></p><p>This solution works for a single developer team or local, development and test environments. It perfectly fits for early stages if the final decision about infrastructure/cloud provider is not made. If not enough DevOps resources are available, this might be the preferred way. Also, costs for running the application are predictable - price per instance. The costs do not directly correlate to the usage amount of executing single functions. This approach does not need a real cloud provider and you can choose cheap (dedicated) servers.</p><p>To have a scalable solution, there is a need to ensure that the message broker and the HTTP proxy/load balancer do not become a single point of failure. They need to be fault tolerant and should be able to scale or at least handle the number of requests.</p><p>The overall workload is distributed across all running instances. In the picture above you can see, that every user request is sent to the HTTP server service of one of the instances. The HTTP server itself invokes the correlating command of the matching service. The invoked service might be executed on the same instance or a different instance. This depends on the message broker and the timing. The command execution result will be sent to the instance, which was receiving the user&#39;s request and will respond to the user&#39;s request.</p><p>Subscriptions are triggered by messages from the message broker.
